# Advanced Programming

## Course organization

What are we going to do?

- learn new programming languages, and to choose the ones that
  better fit with our needs;
- develop a software project throughout the entire course, based
  on a selection of research topics.

There will be 12 lectures, where

- 4 are devoted to the main topics for the projects;
- 4 are devoted to "higher" programming languages;
- 4 are devoted to "lower" programming languages.

There will be 12 lab sessions, where

- 2 are devoted to the bibliographic search and testing on the
  programming language assigned to you;
- 10 are devoted to the software project (details for each lab session
  will be provided later).

How will you be evaluated?

- you'll have to explore (together with another colleague) a new
  programming language and present it to the rest of the class
  (probably during our TDs);
- you'll have to develop one of the proposed software projects
  (together with another colleague, but not the same with whom you'll
  be working on the programming language).

A grade will be assigned to both activities.
No additional exams are planned.
