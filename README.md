# Advanced Programming

## Course organization

This course covers several alternative programming paradigms
and languages. By taking Java as a *middle* level programming 
language, our aim is to explore languages that can be placed 
at lower level (such as C, [llvm](https://llvm.org), and even 
assembly), as well as others that can be placed at higher levels 
(such as the recent [Julia](https://julialang.org/)).

Our pedagogical approach consists of two main steps. On the
one hand, it is planned that we perform a theoretical study 
on a selection of languages, by focusing on their various 
paradigms, on the their syntax, on their performance. This 
part of the work is partially presented by the teacher during 
the lectures, whereas another (quite large and important) part 
of it is rather given as an assignment to the attending students. 
More details can be found below.

On the other hand, an extensive programming work is also 
planned, where each group of students is supposed to develop 
one of the software projects listed below. The paradigm and the 
language used for the development of the chosen project are not 
predefined, it is up to the students to find out which ones better 
fit with each project. Actually, every group of students is 
supposed to prepare a short proposition where they motivate their
choice of the project. The programming languages and software tools 
that they plan to use need to be pointed out as well, together with
a preliminary working plan. It is recommended that each group of 
students writes a proposition for at least 2 of the projects listed
below. It's the teacher who makes the final project assignment to 
each student group on the basis of the received propositions.

This is an *advanced* programming course. The pedagogical
approach may be considered to be "advanced" as well, or if
you prefer, "alternative". In this course, students are not
supposed to repeat to the teacher what they have learned from
the lectures or the assignments in order to get their grade.
Rather, they need to use (part of) the information they are
going to get during the lectures to work on their assignments
in the best possible way. In other words, the information does
not simply need to be acquired, it's the use of the information 
that is actually evaluated at the end. The final grade takes into 
consideration the quality of the work that has been done for 
these two assignments. No additional (classical) exams are 
planned.

## Student groups and assignments

Students are free to choose their (unique) partner in order 
to form a working group on one of the two student assignments.
The only constraint is that every formed group is only allowed
to  work on one of the two assignments. In other works, if you 
are student A, you can form the group AB with student B to work 
on the first assignment, but you cannot work with the same 
student B on the second assignment. You'll have to find 
another student, say C, in order to form another group, 
say AC, and work on the second assignment.

The first assignment consists in exploring a new programming
language and in presenting its main features to the rest
of the class. The programming languages are assigned 
randomly to the groups, and chosen from a set of 
[languages supporting llvm](https://llvm.org/ProjectsWithLLVM/).
Each group can get inspiration on how to present the language 
assigned to them from the lectures that your teacher will give 
on *higher* and *lower* programming languages (see details below).

The second assignment consists in developing a software
project throughout the entire course. The initial lectures
of this course are supposed to give you some insights on
some of the main topics considered in the projects. Once
one of the projects is assigned to your group, please 
follow the scheduled activities (they will appear soon
on this page) for every lab devoted to the projects (10 
over 12).

## Lectures 

There will be 12 lectures, where

- 4 are devoted to the main topics for the projects;
- 4 are devoted to "higher" programming languages;
- 4 are devoted to "lower" programming languages.

### Lectures on project topics

- [Introduction to Distance Geometry](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/slides/DistanceGeometryIntroSlides.pdf);
- [Distance Geometry in 1D, subset sum and optic computing](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/slides/DistanceGeometry1D.pdf);
- [Feature Selection by Biclustering](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/slides/Valparaiso-charla2011.pdf).

Project topics not covered in these presentations are discussed
without supporting slides. 

## List of programming languages

The assignment of the programming language to each
student group is completely random. Please check with
your teacher. The full list includes:

- [Crack](https://crack-lang.org/);
- [D](https://dlang.org/);
- [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/);
- [Pony](https://www.ponylang.io/);
- [Pure](https://agraef.github.io/pure-lang/);
- [Terra](https://terralang.org/).

The first two lab sessions are devoted to the bibliographic 
search and testing of the programming language assigned to the
groups. It's during the TD time-slots that the presentations of
the programming languages will be scheduled (the time at the
disposal of every group for the preparation of such presentations 
is also taken into consideration when assigning the grade; in 
other words, the earlier your group will present, the better your
grade will be for the same presentation).

## List of software projects

Ten of our 12 lab sessions are devoted to the software projects.
Recall that all groups of students are supposed to read *all* projects 
and write a short proposition (including a preliminary working plan) 
for at least two of them. The programming language that you will select
does not need to be one of the other languages studied in this course.
The full list of projects includes:

- [Simulating Optical Circuits](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project1-optics.pdf);
- [Distance Geometry in 1D](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project2-dgp1.pdf);
- [Directed Graphs with Variable Vertex Orders](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project3-graph.pdf);
- [Hardness of Combinatorial Optimization Problems](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project4-hardness.pdf);
- [A Statistical Analysis on Human Motions](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project5-analysis.pdf);
- [Feature Selection by Biclustering](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project6-biclustering.pdf);
- [Combinatorial Optimization for Data Compression](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project7-compression.pdf);
- [The Distance Geometry Game](https://www.antoniomucherino.it/download/PA/project8-game.pdf).

More details for each lab session will be appear on this page a 
little later.
