# High Performance Computing

This content of this page represents an entire course for the 
[ESIR](https://esir.univ-rennes.fr/en/welcome-eisr-graduate-school-excellence)
engineering school of University of Rennes, and partially for the parallel 
computing course taugh at [ISTIC](https://istic.univ-rennes.fr/) for the
software engineering program. The remainder of this second course is
under the resposability of CÃ©dric Tedeschi.

## Lectures on GPU programming

Please find below the main line of lectures:

* Comparisons between CPU and GPU architectures
* Something new we need to pay attention at:
  - code divergence
  - coalesced memory access
* Measuring the performance of GPU programs
* Some simple examples (in pseudo-code):
  - vector sum
  - scalar product
* Main steps in GPU programming
* CUDA language:
  - memory allocation on GPU
  - data transfer between CPU and GPU
  - thread identifiers
  - the kernel
* An complete example in CUDA:
  - [vector sum on GPU](./GPU/vectorsum.cu)
* *To be continued* ...
